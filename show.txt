This is the inspiring story of a blind boy who feels he is no good. He lived in a small world of herding his father's goats. Then one day in 1857, his father and elder brother leave to join the troops of Tantia Tope ( one of the Indian leaders who is fighting the British rulers). As the boy feels sad, forlorn and helpless, a quirk of fate brings him face to face with Tantia Tope, the leader of the Indian army. As a herdsman, he leads the troops of the latter up a hill. This changes the course of the battle.
